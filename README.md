# Enterprise UI Palette Generator

This is a tool to automate the generation of accessible enterprise UI color palettes.

It draws inspiration from [Radix UI's custom color palette tool](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/custom), but its color generation rules are mostly based on those I laid out in a [Medium article I wrote](https://uxdesign.cc/a-systematic-approach-to-generating-enterprise-ui-color-palettes-ecaf0c164c17).
